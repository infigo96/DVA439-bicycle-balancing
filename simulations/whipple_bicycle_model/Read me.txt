Hello Anas

There is a copy of the two papers located in the same folder as the matlab and simulink files.

Note! 
Before running the both of the models, you first need to run the matlab script "DynamicModelParameters"
and to change the velocity for the models you need to change the variable "v" to desired velocity.
